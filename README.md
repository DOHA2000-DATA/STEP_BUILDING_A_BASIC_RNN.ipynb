## 📌 Description  
This project is focused on building a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to understand how these models handle sequential data. The goal is to predict the next value in a numerical sequence using TensorFlow/Keras. This project is particularly useful for those interested in AI, Data Science, and geospatial data applications.

## 🚀 Objectives  
- Understand the fundamentals of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).  
- Implement a basic RNN model using TensorFlow/Keras.  
- Train the model on a numerical sequence and evaluate its performance.  

## 🛠️ Prerequisites  
Before running the notebook, make sure you have the following libraries installed:  

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## 📂 Project Structure  
- `STEP_BUILDING_A_BASIC_RNN.ipynb` : Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation and training of the RNN model.  

## 🔥 Execution  
1. Open the notebook using Jupyter:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook STEP_BUILDING_A_BASIC_RNN.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## 📊 Expected Results  
- A trained RNN model capable of predicting the next value in a sequence.  
- Visualization of predictions compared to actual values.
